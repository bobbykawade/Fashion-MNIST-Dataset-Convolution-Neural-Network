# Fashion-MNIST-Dataset-Convolution-Neural-Network


MNIST dataset which consists of 70,000 images out of which 60,000 images belong to the training set and 10,000 images belong to the test set.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total with ten labels associated with them. 

The pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. 

Each row is a separate image and we have 785 column labels including one class label.

Multiclass Classification Problem so we used Softmax Function and Cross-Entropy

Build Convolutional Neural Network with Tensorflow and Keras Library on top of it.
